## You Enter the House
--- 

You are standing a couple steps from the doorway of this house. 
The door opens *simultaneously* as you approach the door. 


You continue walking and to your left is a living room, 
To your right is a stair case leading upstairs, 
finally straight foward is a staircase to the basement.  
Where are you going?
