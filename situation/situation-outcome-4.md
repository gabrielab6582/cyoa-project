## Invesigate the chair

You sit in the chair and you realize how tired you are without hesitation you fall asleep.  

When you wake up you see the man giving you a blank stare while he slowly tilts his head from the kitchen with a knife tightly gripped in his hands. 
You out of fear sprint out the chair and try to escape the back door but it was locked.     
Leaving you as hopless as a rose in a desert.   
The killer *peirces* you with his knife.
